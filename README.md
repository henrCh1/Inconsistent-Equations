# Inconsistent-Equations
该程序使用Python编写，用于使用最小二乘法求解矛盾方程组。根据线性代数理论，当方程组的数量超过未知数的数量时，方程组通常无解，这种方程组被称为矛盾方程组（也称为超定方程组）。最小二乘法是一种常用的方法，用于解决矛盾方程组。代码中包含详细的注释，以便更好地理解其内容。

This program is written in Python and is used to solve inconsistent systems of equations using the method of least squares. According to linear algebra theory, when the number of equations in a system exceeds the number of unknowns, the system of equations often has no solution, and such a system is called an inconsistent system (also known as an overdetermined system). The method of least squares is a commonly used approach to solve inconsistent systems of equations. The code includes detailed comments to better understand its content.
